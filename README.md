# java-maven-sample

This is an example ready-to-deploy java web application built for Tomcat using Maven and webapp-runner.

## Running Locally

(need maven and java installed)

```
mvn package
java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar target/*.war
```

The application will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Once this project is done and if you need to do clean all, do 

```
mvn clean
```
This will delete the target directory generated by the mvn itself
